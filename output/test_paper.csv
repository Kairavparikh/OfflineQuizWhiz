Main Subject,Sensory Systems,Muscle Spindles,Easy,58529e83-46fd-4dc3-90d1-9856176ba5d8,What is the primary function of muscle spindles in the somatosensory system?,To control muscle contraction and length,To transmit sensory information to the brain about joint position,To regulate heart rate,To detect changes in muscle temperature,B,"Muscle spindles are specialized receptor organs that provide the somatosensory system with information about muscle length and the speed of muscle contraction. They send this sensory data to the brain, which is crucial for maintaining posture and controlling movements (Gelfoam Sensory Physiology, 6th edition, Chapter 10). The incorrect options refer to different functions that other parts of the body perform.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_spindle; Gelfoam Sensory Physiology by John D.

Main Subject,Sensory Systems,Touch Receptors,Easy,345359cd-e0ee-4b89-920b-088c4ca3d6a4,What is the primary type of touch receptor responsible for sensation of pressure and texture in the human skin?,Pacinian corpuscle,Meissner's corpuscle,Merkel's disc,Ruffini ending,D,"The Ruffini endings are mechanoreceptors primarily responsible for sensing deep pressure and tissue deformation, providing information about the direction and magnitude of stretch in the skin. They are located within the lamina propria, a layer of connective tissue beneath the epidermis and above the dermis. The other options—Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner's corpuscles, and Merkel's discs—have specific roles in detecting different aspects of touch sensation.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutaneous_mechanoreceptor; The Sensory Neurobiology of Touch: From Molecules to Man, Edited by David H.

Main Subject,Sensory Systems,Muscle Spindles,Medium,7b8e75e7-0664-43d5-85a2-bc52b07c7d81,A muscle spindle is activated by stretch. Which of the following muscles will have increased alpha motor neuron activity in response to a sudden stretch?,Extrafusal fibers,Intrafusal fibers,Another type of muscle spindle,No change in alpha motor neuron activity,B,"When a muscle spindle is stretched, it sends impulses to the spinal cord, which increases the firing rate of alpha motor neurons responsible for innervating the intrafusal fibers within the muscle spindle. This increased activity causes the muscle spindle to contract, helping maintain or increase the length of the extrafusal fibers (the main contractile component of the muscle).","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92759/; Human Physiology by Berne and Levy, Chapter 62"
