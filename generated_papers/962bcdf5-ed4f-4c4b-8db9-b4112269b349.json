      "question_text_en": "A vector's magnitude can be found using which formula?",
      "option_a_en": "v = (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(1/2)",
      "option_b_en": "v = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)",
      "option_c_en": "v = x + y + z",
      "option_d_en": "v = x - y - z",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. This formula, v = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), allows us to find the length of the vector in three-dimensional space.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "While speed and velocity are derived quantities in physics, temperature is a fundamental physical quantity. It describes the thermal state of matter. On the other hand, speed is a scalar that measures how fast an object moves without regard to direction.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The acceleration due to gravity on the Earth's surface is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s\u00b2). This value, commonly denoted as g, is used in calculations related to falling objects, projectiles, and other situations involving gravitational forces.",
