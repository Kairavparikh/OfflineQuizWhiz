      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Assuming a typical PDF file has an average size of 200 bytes per page (depending on image content and fonts), for a 20-page document the total number of bytes would be 40,000 bytes. For larger files with more images or complex fonts, the number of bytes per page may increase.",
